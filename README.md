♞ Knight Moves – Shortest Path Finder
This JavaScript function calculates the shortest path a knight can take on a standard 8x8 chessboard from a given starting position to a target position. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to ensure the shortest path is always found.

✅ Example Usage
knightMoves([0, 0], [7, 7]);
// ➜ Possible output: [[0, 0], [2, 1], [4, 2], [6, 3], [4, 4], [6, 5], [7, 7]]

🔍 Features
Uses BFS for optimal pathfinding
Returns all steps from start to end
Ignores already visited squares
Fully contained and ready for use or extension
